Data Exploration, investigate the data : just know it\
-> use graphic to understand the corolations, distributions\
-> show the missing value percentage

Bad data -> wrong decision

Incomplete
Inconstancy (wrong action, non delete propagation)

Ways to do data analytics :
- is the data structured/unstructured
- does the data lineage ?
- data get transformed ?
- fix data type
- having a document to map business value

|Technique|Description|
|-|-|
|Restricting|filtering : by a fix value|
|Sifting|like filtering but with multiple values : everything from $this_date to $today|
Grouping|spliting the data + applying agregation function + combining|

Data Profiling :

````python
df.info()
# Give some counts about the data
df.describe
# Give the five numbers (med, mean, quartile, mod)
````

````
Note :
- Mod -> most occured data. It's the data with the greater frequency
````
````python
import pandas_profiling
# Can give some further statistics about the data set
# Can give some further statistics about the data attribut
````
