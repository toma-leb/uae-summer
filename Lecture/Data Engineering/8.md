# Chapiter 8 : Data preparation

- Mean : moyenne
- Median : m√©diane
- Mode : the most common value in the data 

Interquatile range : define the distance between the 3rd and the first quartile

5 numbers summary :
- minimum
- 25th percentile
- median
- 75th percentile
- maixmum

````
alwayes take the round of the value
````

IQR (inter quartile range) : 3rd quartile - 1st quartile  
- Upper boundary : Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
- Lower Boundary : Q1 + 1.5 * IQR

## Unbalanced labels

It's where two antinomyque categories haven't got the same size. It is about avoiding bias.

- downsampling : removing things from the majority class
    - samples of majority class 
    - shuffling the class
    - reproduce data 
    - NearMiss-1 : remove the 3 items that are closest to an other item in categorie.
    - NearMiss-2 : remove the 3 items that are furthest to an other item in categorie.
    - NearMiss-3 : remove the 3 items that are closest to the mean item in categorie.
- uppersampling : adding things to the minority class
    - copies of minority class
    - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) : adding synthetique value but taking into account the distribution.  
    - K-Nearest Method : classifier based on the neither categorize item. K means how many items taking into account. 
    We can the discriminise by change the classes of items if they are closest to the other categorie items.
