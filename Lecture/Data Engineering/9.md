# Chapiter 9 : Feature Selection and Extraction

Lost Accuracy to increase performance
Dimension reduction

## Selection

Reducing dimension by removing the unecessary feature
Highly corolotated features are useless. 

- filtering : rank somehow and select the n highest score

- wrapper : selection with an evaluation 
    - forward selection : Adding more feature before evaluating
    - backward elimination : starting from the biggest group of feature and decreasing it

Usefull to find the optimal number of features. 

## Extraction

- Generating new feature
- Reduction : create new feature but remove old feature at the same time (LTA)
