# Data Ingestion

## Metadata

Metadata is data about data like :
- Photos : Filename, Author, Date, File, Camera, Lens, Exposure, Flash
- Excel files : first row
- DataBases : the describe of the table (name, type, constrain, domaine, size)

Usefull, if their is null values.

```Python
import numpy as np

np.isNan(1)
# Output : False
np.isNan("b")
# Output : True
```

```
Note :
- Find the frequency of null or nan values
```

# Data Lineage

The ability to trace back the source of a dataset to how it was created.
You have to create metadata or update metadata at each ETL stages.

5 W's :
- Who is using the data ?
- When the data is created/updated ?
- What information does the data contain ?
- How is it being used ?
- Why does the data exist ?

Fact table : collect data from the dimensions and agregated data

# Cube Model Operations

- Slicing : extract a 2D plan from 3D plan, filter the data on one dimension
- Dicing : extract a part (linear coordinate) from the cube, filter the data on more than one dimension or on more than one value
- Pivot : rotate the cube on 1 axis
- Drill-Down : showing the data from a single coordinate
- Roll-Up : summarize
