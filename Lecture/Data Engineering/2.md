# Data Engineering

## Data Science vs Data Engineering

### Definitions 

<b>Data Science</b>: is a field that combine programming skilles, knowledge of mathematics and statistic to extract meaningful insights from data

Subfields : 
1. Data Engineering :
    - Deals with a variety of data formats, storage, data extraction and transformation.
    - Data Management, Production (automations, system integration)
2. Data Modeling : 
    - Using the data we have to estimate the data we wish we had
    - Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Custom algorithm developement
3. Data Analysis : 
    - Turning raw information into knowledge that can be acted on
    - Domain Knowledge, Research, Interpretation

### Data Engineering Responsabilities

- Analyzing and organizing raw data 
- Building data systems and pipelines
- Evaluating data 
- Interpreting trends and patterns (data exploration)
- Building algorithms and prototypes
- Developing analytical tools and programs

#### Kind of analytics :
- Prediction
- Descriptive
- Prescriptive

### DataBase 

|Type|Language|
|-|-|
|Relational database|SQL|
|Unrelational database|NoSQL|

Exemple of unrelational database:
- Key-Value
- Column-Familly
- Graph
- Document

|Relational Type|Definition|
|-|-|
|Row-Store|every attribut is link|
|Column-Store|every attribut is independant|

### ETL (extract, transform, load)

<b>Data Warehousing</b> : big repository that collect data from many sources with structured data (with schema)

Extract : collect data from many sources\
Transform : structured data (optional)\
Load : repository

### ELT (extraxtion, loading, transform)

<b>Data Lake</b> : big repositroy that collect data from many sources with unstructured data (can be a part of structured, semi and unstructures). Here we've got to use a software to read data

### Data Extraction

Pre-Processing or Data Preparation : format, fixing issues
All data sources can be used (ERP, CRM, web pages, emails...)

### Data Loading

If local machine it's only the fact to download the data. On a platform, it's mean putting data into the stream.


Note :

#### 3V of BigData

Volume, Velocity, Variaty

#### Dimentional data
