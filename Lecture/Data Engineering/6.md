# ETL Time Series

````
Note :

- Roll Up -> downsampling -> to lower frequency -> dimension 
  Drill Down -> upsampling -> to higher frequency

- Curse Dimensitionality : solution is downsampling either row or column 

- Rolling -> change window size of the data by taking 7 days and do the mean of the value

- Data Mining -> unsupervised clustering text
  Machine Learning -> supervised

- Clusterisation (Pre-processing) -> can create label -> Classification

- Text-Classification -> Machine Learning Problem
